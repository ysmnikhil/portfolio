The development for this is in progress :)

This is a portfolio application that is built using `React (Next.js)`, `Tailwind CSS`.

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local server, you can simply clone it or download it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ysmnikhil/portfolio.git
```

Install the packages using this command

```bash
npm ci
# or
yarn install
```

Run this command to see the application in the action for development

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learn More
`WIP` I will be adding more information for the same.

## Deploy on Github
This repository already contains GitHub's action for the same. See `.github/workflows/node.js.yml`. To work with this, you just need to update the `Settings > Pages > Branch to Public` for your GitHub repository within your account. Go to

`https://github.com/{UR_USERNAME}/{UR_RESPOSITORY}/settings/pages`

Let's say your username and repository are these `ysmnikhil` and `portfolio` then the path will be

`https://github.com/ysmnikhil/portfolio/settings/pages`

after these changes, you should be able to see your portfolio similar to this URL

`https://ysmnikhil.github.io/portfolio`

`WIP` I will be adding a blog for the same.

## Roadmap
- ~~GitHub's action for static the page.~~
- Replacement of the components and utils.
- Test Cases
- Dockerization
- Add a flavor of [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) for the backend API instead of JSON files.
- Blog
    - AMP pages
